# Hi there, I'm Rushiraj (Krish) Pathak 👋  

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a **Data Analyst** and **Data Engineer** based in Toronto, ON with a passion for turning complex data into meaningful insights (and maybe making it a little more fun along the way). With a background in **agile methodologies**, **big data technologies**, and a variety of programming languages, I’m here to solve your toughest data challenges (and throw in a bit of humor while I’m at it).

## 🚀 About Me
With **3+ years of experience** in data engineering and a **Master's in Project Management** from Birmingham City University, The UK, I’ve worked on everything from **automotive AI** to **roadway data analytics**. My day-to-day? Making data dance with the power of **Power BI**, **Tableau**, **Python**, **SQL**, and anything else that helps create user-centric solutions. 

My passion for data doesn’t stop at work – I’m currently working towards my **Data Analysis program** at **Seneca Polytechnic** to level up my skills and keep pushing boundaries. 

## 🎯 Skills
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI, Tableau (I make dashboards so pretty, they might just make you cry)
- **Programming**: Python, Java, HTML (Yes, I’m fluent in three languages... and they’re all code.)
- **Frontend**: React, Redux, TypeScript, Next.js (I’m the wizard behind the screen)
- **Databases**: SQL & NoSQL (Because one is never enough!)
- **Other**: Code Debugging & Documentation (Making bugs disappear like magic)
- **OS**: Linux, MAC, Windows (I can work anywhere, even on Mars... if they had WiFi)

## 👨‍💻 Experience

*August 2021 – January 2024*  
- I turned data into actionable insights through **Power BI** dashboards.
- Helped solve road traffic problems (yes, I made the roads smarter).  
- Managed a team of 12 (because someone had to keep everyone on track).  
- Used **Sumo Logic** to hunt down data drops and raised **Zendesk tickets** like a pro.

### Computer Engineer | Atul Auto | Rajkot, Gujarat, India
*October 2019 – January 2021*  
- Designed and implemented **AI-driven solutions** to make vehicles smarter.  
- Kept everything running smoothly by designing and maintaining databases (because data is the backbone of everything).  
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to deploy embedded systems (I call this “engineering magic”).
